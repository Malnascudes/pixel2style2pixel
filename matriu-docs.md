Main file `image_inference.py` computes average image of the images present in `images_path` and stores it at `output_path`. File created with a mix of methods fom `predict.py` and `notebooks/inference_playground.ipynb` and adaptations to it to perform on a list of images.

Run with
```
python image_inference.py
```

Currently working on GPU but maybe it can be adapted to CPU use.
